ctrans.py
---------

very crude source code comment translator. powered by google translate.

currently handles C-style and scripting-style (i.e. '#') comments; note that
comments formatted as '### comment' will still end up as '# comment', this
is a bug i don't care about fixing atm; i'm more concerned with just getting
this working.


USAGE:
    ctrans.py -s <filename>
    translates a single file

    ctrans.py -d <dir>
    translates all source files in a directory
    

TODO:
    * add directory-translating mode
    * add support for multiline C comment
    * verify code is clean, was hacked together in a hurry
